abstract: Background Adolescence is a period of high risk for the onset of depression,
  characterized by variability in symptoms, severity, and course. During adolescence,
  the neurocircuitry implicated in depression continues to mature, suggesting that
  it is an important period for intervention. Reflecting the recent emergence of ‘precision
  mental health’ – a person-centered approach to identifying, preventing, and treating
  psychopathology – researchers have begun to document associations between heterogeneity
  in features of depression and individual differences in brain circuitry, most frequently
  in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Methods In this review, we present
  emerging work examining pre- and post-treatment measures of network connectivity
  in depressed adolescents; these studies reveal potential intervention-specific neural
  markers of treatment efficacy. We also review findings from studies examining associations
  between network connectivity and both types of depressive symptoms and response
  to treatment in adults, and indicate how this work can be extended to depressed
  adolescents. Finally, we offer recommendations for research that we believe will
  advance the science of precision mental health of adolescence. Results Nascent studies
  suggest that linking RSFC-based pathophysiological variation with effects of different
  types of treatment and changes in mood following specific interventions will strengthen
  predictions of prognosis and treatment response. Studies with larger sample sizes
  and direct comparisons of treatments are required to determine whether RSFC patterns
  are reliable neuromarkers of treatment response for depressed adolescents. Although
  we are not yet at the point of using RSFC to guide clinical decision-making, findings
  from research examining the stability and reliability of RSFC point to a favorable
  future for network-based clinical phenotyping. Conclusions Delineating the correspondence
  between specific clinical characteristics of depression (e.g., symptoms, severity,
  and treatment response) and patterns of network-based connectivity will facilitate
  the development of more tailored and effective approaches to the assessment, prevention,
  and treatment of depression in adolescents.
