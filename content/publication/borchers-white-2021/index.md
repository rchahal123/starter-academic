abstract: Internalizing symptoms typically emerge in adolescence and are more prevalent
  in females than in males; in contrast, externalizing symptoms typically emerge in
  childhood and are more commonly observed in males. Previous research has implicated
  aspects of white matter organization, including fractional anisotropy (FA), of cerebral
  tracts in both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Although the cerebellum
  has been posited to integrate limbic and cortical regions, its role in psychopathology
  is not well understood. In this longitudinal study, we investigated whether FA of
  the superior (SCP), middle (MCP), and inferior cerebellar peduncles (ICP) predict
  change in symptoms and whether sex moderates this association. One hundred eleven
  adolescents completed the Youth Self-Report, assessing symptoms at baseline (ages
  9–13 years) and again 2 years later. Participants also underwent diffusion-weighted
  imaging at baseline. We used deterministic tractography to segment and compute mean
  FA of the cerebellar peduncles. Lower FA of the right SCP at baseline predicted
  increases in internalizing symptoms in females only. Lower FA in the right SCP and
  ICP also predicted increases in externalizing symptoms in females, but these associations
  did not survive multiple comparison correction. There was no association between
  FA of the cerebellar peduncles and change in symptoms in males or between MCP FA
  and symptom changes in males or females. Organizational properties of the SCP may
  be a sex-specific marker of internalizing symptom changes in adolescence. The cerebellar
  peduncles should be explored further in future studies to elucidate sex differences
  in symptoms.
