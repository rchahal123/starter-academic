abstract: Background Girls’ depressive symptoms typically increase in adolescence,
  with individual differences in course and severity being key risk factors for impaired
  emotional functioning in young adulthood. Given the continued brain white matter
  (WM) maturation that occurs in adolescence, the present study tested whether structural
  connectivity patterns in late adolescence are associated with variation in the course
  of depression symptom severity throughout adolescence. Method Participants were
  girls (N = 115) enrolled in a multiyear prospective cohort study of risk for depression.
  Initial depression severity (intercept) at age 10 and change in severity (linear
  slope) across ages 10–19 were examined in relation to WM tractography collected
  at age 19. Network-based statistic analyses were used to identify clusters showing
  variation in structural connectivity in association with depressive symptom intercept,
  slope, and their interaction. Results Higher initial depressive severity and steeper
  positive slope (separately) were associated with greater structural connectivity
  between temporal, subcortical socioaffective, and occipital regions. Intercept showed
  more connectivity associations than slope. The interaction effect indicated that
  higher initial symptom severity and a steeper negative slope (i.e., alleviating
  symptoms) were related to greater connectivity between cognitive control regions.
  Moderately severe symptoms that worsened over time were followed by greater connectivity
  between self-referential and cognitive regions (e.g., posterior cingulate and frontal
  gyrus). Conclusions Higher depressive symptom severity in early adolescence and
  increasing symptom severity over time may forecast structural connectivity differences
  in late adolescence, particularly in pathways involving cognitive and emotion-processing
  regions. Understanding how clinical course relates to neurobiological correlates
  may inform new treatment approaches to adolescent depression.
