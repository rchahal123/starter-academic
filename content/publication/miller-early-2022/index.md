abstract: An alarming high proportion of youth experience at least one kind of stressor
  in childhood and/or adolescence. Exposure to early life stress is associated with
  increased risk for psychopathology, accelerated biological aging, and poor physical
  health; however, it is important to recognize that not all youth who experience
  such stress go on to develop difficulties. In fact, resilience, or positive adaptation
  in the face of adversity, is relatively common. Individual differences in vulnerability
  or resilience to the effects of early stress may be represented in the brain as
  specific patterns, profiles, or signatures of neural activation, structure, and
  connectivity (i.e., neurophenotypes). Whereas neurophenotypes of risk that reflect
  the deleterious effects of early stress on the developing brain are likely to exacerbate
  negative outcomes in youth, neurophenotypes of resilience may reduce the risk of
  experiencing these negative outcomes and instead promote positive functioning. In
  this chapter we describe our perspective concerning the neurobiological mechanisms
  and moderators of risk and resilience in adolescence following early life stress
  and integrate our own work into this framework. We present findings suggesting that
  exposure to stress in childhood and adolescence is associated with functional and
  structural alterations in neurobiological systems that are important for social-affective
  processing and for cognitive control. While some of these neurobiological alterations
  increase risk for psychopathology, they may also help to limit adolescentsâ€™ sensitivity
  to subsequent negative experiences. We also discuss person-centered strategies that
  we believe can advance our understanding of risk and resilience to early stress
  in adolescents. Finally, we describe ways in which the field can broaden its focus
  to include a consideration of other types of environmental factors, such as environmental
  pollutants, in affecting both risk and resilience to stress-related health difficulties
  in youth.
