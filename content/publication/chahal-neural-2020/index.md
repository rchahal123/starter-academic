abstract: 'BackgroundNeurophysiological patterns may distinguish which youth are at
  risk for the well-documented increase in internalizing symptoms during adolescence.
  Adolescents with internalizing problems exhibit altered resting-state functional
  connectivity (RSFC) of brain regions involved in socio-affective processing. Whether
  connectivity-based biotypes differentiate adolescentsâ€™ levels of internalizing problems
  remains unknown.MethodSixty-eight adolescents (37 females) reported on their internalizing
  problems at ages 14, 16, and 18 years. A resting-state functional neuroimaging scan
  was collected at age 16. Time-series data of 15 internalizing-relevant brain regions
  were entered into the Subgroup-Group Iterative Multi-Model Estimation program to
  identify subgroups based on RSFC maps. Associations between internalizing problems
  and connectivity-based biotypes were tested with regression analyses.ResultsTwo
  connectivity-based biotypes were found: a Diffusely-connected biotype (N = 46),
  with long-range fronto-parietal paths, and a Hyper-connected biotype (N = 22), with
  paths between subcortical and medial frontal areas (e.g. affective and default-mode
  network regions). Higher levels of past (age 14) internalizing problems predicted
  a greater likelihood of belonging to the Hyper-connected biotype at age 16. The
  Hyper-connected biotype showed higher levels of concurrent problems (age 16) and
  future (age 18) internalizing problems.ConclusionsDifferential patterns of RSFC
  among socio-affective brain regions were predicted by earlier internalizing problems
  and predicted future internalizing problems in adolescence. Measuring connectivity-based
  biotypes in adolescence may offer insight into which youth face an elevated risk
  for internalizing disorders during this critical developmental period.'
