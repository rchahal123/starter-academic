abstract: Patterns of pubertal maturation have been linked to vulnerability for emotion
  dysregulation disorders in girls, as well as white matter (WM) development, suggestive
  of a potential mechanism between pubertal maturation and emotional health. Because
  pubertal processes begin at varying ages (i.e., status, timing) and proceed at varying
  rates (i.e., tempo), identifying individual differences in the pubertal course associated
  with subsequent WM microstructure development may reveal clues about neurobiological
  mechanisms of girls' emotional well-being. In a prospective cohort study of 107
  girls, we examined associations between pubertal status at age 9, pubertal timing
  and tempo from ages 9-15, and WM microstructure at age 19. Tract-based spatial statistics
  revealed that girls with more advanced pubertal status at age 9, specific to gonadal-related
  physical changes, had higher fractional anisotropy, and lower mean diffusivity (MD)
  and radial diffusivity in tracts relevant to cognitive control and emotion regulation
  (e.g., the superior longitudinal fasciculus, external capsule, and uncinate fasciculus).
  Additionally, girls with earlier pubertal timing showed lower MD in the left anterior
  cingulum bundle. Tempo was unrelated to WM measures. These findings implicate specific
  aspects of pubertal maturation in subsequent neural signatures, suggesting possible
  neuroendocrine mechanisms relevant to emotional development. Future work incorporating
  longitudinal neuroimaging in parallel with pubertal measures may contribute to the
  understanding of individual variation in pubertal course and WM development.
