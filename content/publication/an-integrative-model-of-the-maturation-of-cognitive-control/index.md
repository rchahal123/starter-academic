abstract: Brains systems undergo unique and specific dynamic changes at the
  cellular, circuit, and systems level that underlie the transition to
  adult-level cognitive control. We integrate literature from these different
  levels of analyses to propose a novel model of the brain basis of the
  development of cognitive control. The ability to consistently exert cognitive
  control improves into adulthood as the flexible integration of component
  processes, including inhibitory control, performance monitoring, and working
  memory, increases. Unique maturational changes in brain structure, supported
  by interactions between dopaminergic and GABAergic systems, contribute to
  enhanced network synchronization and an improved signal-to-noise ratio. In
  turn, these factors facilitate the specialization and strengthening of
  connectivity in networks supporting the transition to adult levels of
  cognitive control. This model provides a novel understanding of the adolescent
  period as an adaptive period of heightened experience-seeking necessary for
  the specialization of brain systems supporting cognitive control.
