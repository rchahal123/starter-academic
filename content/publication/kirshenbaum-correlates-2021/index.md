abstract: 'Background Suicidal ideation (SI) typically emerges during adolescence
  but is challenging to predict. Given the potentially lethal consequences of SI,
  it is important to identify neurobiological and psychosocial variables explaining
  the severity of SI in adolescents. Methods In 106 participants (59 female) recruited
  from the community, we assessed psychosocial characteristics and obtained resting-state
  fMRI data in early adolescence (baseline: aged 9–13 years). Across 250 brain regions,
  we assessed local graph theory-based properties of interconnectedness: local efficiency,
  eigenvector centrality, nodal degree, within-module z-score, and participation coefficient.
  Four years later (follow-up: ages 13–19 years), participants self-reported their
  SI severity. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regressions
  to identify a linear combination of psychosocial and brain-based variables that
  best explain the severity of SI symptoms at follow-up. Nested-cross-validation yielded
  model performance statistics for all LASSO models. Results A combination of psychosocial
  and brain-based variables explained subsequent severity of SI (R2 = .55); the strongest
  was internalizing and externalizing symptom severity at follow-up. Follow-up LASSO
  regressions of psychosocial-only and brain-based-only variables indicated that psychosocial-only
  variables explained 55% of the variance in SI severity; in contrast, brain-based-only
  variables performed worse than the null model. Conclusions A linear combination
  of baseline and follow-up psychosocial variables best explained the severity of
  SI. Follow-up analyses indicated that graph theory resting-state metrics did not
  increase the prediction of the severity of SI in adolescents. Attending to internalizing
  and externalizing symptoms is important in early adolescence; resting-state connectivity
  properties other than local graph theory metrics might yield a stronger prediction
  of the severity of SI.'
