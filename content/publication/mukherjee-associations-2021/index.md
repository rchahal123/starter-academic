abstract: 'Objective: Irritability is a common characteristic in ADHD. We examined
  whether dysfunction in neural connections supporting threat and reward processing
  was related to irritability in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Method: We
  used resting-state fMRI to assess connectivity of amygdala and nucleus accumbens
  seeds in those with ADHD (n = 34) and an age- and gender-matched typically-developing
  comparison group (n = 34). Results: In those with ADHD, irritability was associated
  with atypical functional connectivity of both seed regions. Amygdala seeds showed
  greater connectivity with right inferior frontal gyrus and caudate/putamen, and
  less connectivity with precuneus. Nucleus accumbens seeds showed altered connectivity
  with middle temporal gyrus and precuneus. Conclusion: The irritability-ADHD presentation
  is associated with atypical functional connectivity of reward and threat processing
  regions with cognitive control and emotion processing regions. These patterns provide
  novel evidence for irritability-associated neural underpinnings in adolescents and
  young adults with ADHD. The findings suggest cognitive and behavioral treatments
  that address response to reward, including omission of an expected reward and irritability,
  may be beneficial for ADHD.'
