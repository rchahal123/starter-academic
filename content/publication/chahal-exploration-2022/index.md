abstract: 'Different dimensions of adversity may affect mental health through distinct
  neurobiological mechanisms, though current supporting evidence consists largely
  of cross-sectional associations between threat or deprivation and fronto-limbic
  circuitry. In this exploratory three-wave longitudinal study spanning ages 9â€“19
  years, we examined the associations between experiences of unpredictability, threat,
  and deprivation with the development of functional connectivity within and between
  three brain networks implicated in psychopathology: the salience (SAL), default
  mode (DMN), and fronto-parietal (FPN) networks, and tested whether network trajectories
  moderated associations between adversity and changes in internalizing symptoms.
  Connectivity decreased with age on average; these changes differed by dimension
  of adversity. Whereas family-level deprivation was associated with lower initial
  levels and more stability across most networks, unpredictability was associated
  with stability only in SAL connectivity, and threat was associated with stability
  in FPN and DMN-SAL connectivity. In youth exposed to higher levels of any adversity,
  lower initial levels and more stability in connectivity were related to smaller
  increases in internalizing symptoms. Our findings suggest that whereas deprivation
  is associated with widespread neurodevelopmental differences in cognitive and emotion
  processing networks, unpredictability is related selectively to salience detection
  circuitry. Studies with wider developmental windows should examine whether these
  neurodevelopmental alterations are adaptive or serve to maintain internalizing symptoms.'
