abstract: "Background: Exposure to early life stress (ELS) is alarmingly prevalent\
  \ and has been linked to the high rates of depression documented in adolescence.\
  \ Researchers have theorized that ELS may increase adolescents' vulnerability or\
  \ reactivity to the effects of subsequent stressors, placing them at higher risk\
  \ for developing symptoms of depression. Methods: We tested this formulation in\
  \ a longitudinal study by assessing levels of stress and depression during the COVID-19\
  \ pandemic in a sample of adolescents from the San Francisco Bay Area (N = 109;\
  \ 43 male; ages 13-20 years) who had been characterized 3-7 years earlier (M = 5.06,\
  \ SD = 0.86 years) with respect to exposure to ELS and symptoms of depression. Results:\
  \ As expected, severity of ELS predicted levels of depressive symptoms during the\
  \ pandemic [r(107) = 0.26, p = 0.006], which were higher in females than in males\
  \ [t(107) = -3.56, p textless 0.001]. Importantly, the association between ELS and\
  \ depression was mediated by adolescents' reported levels of stress, even after\
  \ controlling for demographic variables. Conclusions: These findings underscore\
  \ the importance of monitoring the mental health of vulnerable children and adolescents\
  \ during this pandemic and targeting perceived stress in high-risk youth."
