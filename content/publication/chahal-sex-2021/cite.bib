 abstract = {Researchers have reported sex-differentiated maturation of white matter (WM) during puberty. It is not clear, however, whether such distinctions contribute to documented sex differences in sensitivity to reward and punishment during adolescence. Given the role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in reward and punishment-related behaviors, we tested in a cross-sectional study whether males and females (N = 156, 89 females; ages 9–14 years) differ in the association between pubertal stage and fixel-based morphometry of WM fibers connecting the OFC and NAcc (i.e., the fronto-accumbal tract). Further, we examined whether males and females differ in associations between fronto-accumbal WM measures and self-reported sensitivity to reward and punishment. Pubertal stage was positively associated with fronto-accumbal fiber density and cross-section (FDC) in males, but not in females. Consistent with previous reports, males reported higher reward sensitivity than did females, although fronto-accumbal combined FDC was not related to reward sensitivity in either sex. Meanwhile, only males showed a negative association between fronto-accumbal tract FDC and sensitivity to punishment. Follow-up analyses revealed that fiber cross-section, but not density, was related to pubertal stage and punishment sensitivity in males, as well as to reward sensitivity in all participants. Our findings suggest there are sex differences in puberty-related maturation of the fronto-accumbal tract, and this tract is related to lower punishment sensitivity in adolescent males compared to females.},
