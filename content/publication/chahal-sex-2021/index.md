abstract: Researchers have reported sex-differentiated maturation of white matter
  (WM) during puberty. It is not clear, however, whether such distinctions contribute
  to documented sex differences in sensitivity to reward and punishment during adolescence.
  Given the role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in
  reward and punishment-related behaviors, we tested in a cross-sectional study whether
  males and females (N = 156, 89 females; ages 9–14 years) differ in the association
  between pubertal stage and fixel-based morphometry of WM fibers connecting the OFC
  and NAcc (i.e., the fronto-accumbal tract). Further, we examined whether males and
  females differ in associations between fronto-accumbal WM measures and self-reported
  sensitivity to reward and punishment. Pubertal stage was positively associated with
  fronto-accumbal fiber density and cross-section (FDC) in males, but not in females.
  Consistent with previous reports, males reported higher reward sensitivity than
  did females, although fronto-accumbal combined FDC was not related to reward sensitivity
  in either sex. Meanwhile, only males showed a negative association between fronto-accumbal
  tract FDC and sensitivity to punishment. Follow-up analyses revealed that fiber
  cross-section, but not density, was related to pubertal stage and punishment sensitivity
  in males, as well as to reward sensitivity in all participants. Our findings suggest
  there are sex differences in puberty-related maturation of the fronto-accumbal tract,
  and this tract is related to lower punishment sensitivity in adolescent males compared
  to females.
