abstract: Sensation seeking is a personality construct associated with an increased
  propensity for engaging in risk-taking. Associations with deleterious outcomes ranging
  from mental health impairments to increased mortality rates highlight important
  public health concerns related to this construct. Although some have suggested that
  increased neural responsivity to reward within the ventral striatum (e.g., nucleus
  accumbens) may drive sensation seeking behaviors, few studies have examined the
  neural mechanisms associated with stable individual differences in sensation seeking
  across development. To address this issue, the current study used functional magnetic
  resonance imaging to examine the association between neural responding to reward
  and stable patterns of sensation seeking across a three-year follow-up period among
  healthy adolescents and young adults (N = 139). Results indicated that during early
  adolescence (~ages 10-12), increased reactivity to reward within the nucleus accumbens
  (NAcc) was associated with lower levels of sensation seeking across a three-year
  follow-up. In middle adolescence (~ages 12-16), there was no evidence of a relationship
  between NAcc reactivity and sensation seeking. However, during the transition from
  late adolescence into adulthood (~ages 17-25), heightened reward-related reactivity
  in the NAcc was linked to increased sensation seeking. Findings suggest that the
  neural mechanisms underlying individual differences in trait-like levels of sensation
  seeking change from early to late adolescence.
