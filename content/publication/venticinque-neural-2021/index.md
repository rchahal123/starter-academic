abstract: Young adults are acutely sensitive to peer influences. Differences have
  been found in neural sensitivity to explicit peer influences, such as seeing peer
  ratings on social media. The present study aimed to identify patterns of neural
  sensitivity to implicit peer influences, which involve more subtle cues that shape
  preferences and behaviors. Participants were 43 young adults (MAge = 19.2 years;
  24 males) who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing a
  task used to assess neural responses to implicitly “socially tagged” symbols (previously
  judged by peers as liked vs. not liked, thus differing in apparent popularity) vs.
  novel symbols that carried no social meaning (not judged by peers). Results indicated
  greater activity in brain regions involved in salience detection (e.g., anterior
  cingulate cortex) and reward processing (e.g., caudate) to socially tagged vs. novel
  symbols, and particularly to unpopular symbols. Greater self-reported susceptibility
  to peer influence was related to more activity in the insula and caudate when viewing
  socially tagged vs. novel symbols. These results suggest that the brain is sensitive
  to even subtle cues varying in level of peer endorsement and neural sensitivity
  differed by the tendency to conform to peers’ behaviors particularly in regions
  implicated in social motivation.
