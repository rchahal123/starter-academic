 abstract = {Early life stress (ELS) is associated with increased risk for internalizing disorders and variations in gray matter development. It is unclear, however, whether ELS affects normative age-related changes in white matter (WM) morphology, and if such maturational differences are associated with risk for internalizing psychopathology. We conducted comprehensive interviews in a cross-sectional sample of young adolescents (N = 156; 89 F; Ages 9â€“14) to assess lifetime exposure to stress and objective cumulative ELS severity. We used diffusion-weighted imaging to measure WM fixel-based morphometry and tested the effects of age and ELS on WM fiber density and cross-section (FDC), and associations between WM FDC and internalizing problems. Age was positively associated with FDC in all WM tracts; greater ELS severity was related to stronger age-WM associations in several association tracts connecting the frontal lobes with limbic, parietal, and occipital regions, including bilateral superior and inferior longitudinal and uncinate fasciculi (UF). Among older adolescents with greater ELS severity, a higher UF FDC was associated with fewer internalizing problems. Greater ELS severity predicted more mature WM morphometry in tracts implicated in emotion regulation and cognitive processing. More phenotypically mature UF WM may be adaptive against internalizing psychopathology in adolescents exposed to ELS.},
