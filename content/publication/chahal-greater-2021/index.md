abstract: Early life stress (ELS) is associated with increased risk for internalizing
  disorders and variations in gray matter development. It is unclear, however, whether
  ELS affects normative age-related changes in white matter (WM) morphology, and if
  such maturational differences are associated with risk for internalizing psychopathology.
  We conducted comprehensive interviews in a cross-sectional sample of young adolescents
  (N = 156; 89 F; Ages 9â€“14) to assess lifetime exposure to stress and objective cumulative
  ELS severity. We used diffusion-weighted imaging to measure WM fixel-based morphometry
  and tested the effects of age and ELS on WM fiber density and cross-section (FDC),
  and associations between WM FDC and internalizing problems. Age was positively associated
  with FDC in all WM tracts; greater ELS severity was related to stronger age-WM associations
  in several association tracts connecting the frontal lobes with limbic, parietal,
  and occipital regions, including bilateral superior and inferior longitudinal and
  uncinate fasciculi (UF). Among older adolescents with greater ELS severity, a higher
  UF FDC was associated with fewer internalizing problems. Greater ELS severity predicted
  more mature WM morphometry in tracts implicated in emotion regulation and cognitive
  processing. More phenotypically mature UF WM may be adaptive against internalizing
  psychopathology in adolescents exposed to ELS.
