abstract: Background Early pubertal maturation has been posited to be a biopsychosocial
  risk factor for the onset of internalizing psychopathology in adolescence; further,
  early-maturing youths exhibit heightened reactivity to stressful events. School
  closures and enforced social distancing, as well as health and financial uncertainties,
  during the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to adversely affect mental health in youths,
  particularly adolescents who are already at risk for experiencing emotional difficulties.
  The executive control network (ECN) supports cognitive processes required to successfully
  navigate novel challenges and regulate emotions in stressful contexts. Methods We
  examined whether functional coherence of the ECN, measured using resting-state functional
  magnetic resonance imaging 5 years before the pandemic (T1), is a neurobiological
  marker of resilience to increases in the severity of internalizing symptoms during
  COVID-19 in adolescents who were in more advanced stages of puberty at T1 relative
  to their same-age peers (NÂ = 85, 49 female). Results On average, participants reported
  an increase in symptoms from the 3 months before pandemic to the 2 most recent weeks
  during the pandemic. We found that early-maturing youths exhibited greater increases
  in internalizing symptoms during the pandemic if their ECN coherence was low; in
  contrast, relative pubertal stage was not associated with changes in internalizing
  symptoms in adolescents with higher ECN coherence at T1. Conclusions These findings
  highlight the role of the functional architecture of the brain that supports executive
  functioning in protecting against risk factors that may exacerbate symptoms of internalizing
  psychopathology during periods of stress and uncertainty.
