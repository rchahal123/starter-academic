abstract: Background Neurobiological measures may inform our understanding of individual
  differences in adolescents’ general risk for and resilience to depressive symptoms,
  including during the COVID-19 pandemic. We tested a developmental model linking
  variation in amygdala–subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) resting-state
  connectivity to perceived parenting experiences earlier in adolescence, to concurrent
  depressive symptoms before the pandemic, and to subsequent depressive symptoms during
  the pandemic. Methods We used data from a longitudinal study that included three
  waves (N = 214 adolescents; ages 9–15 years at time 1 [T1], 11–17 years at T2, and
  12–19 years during the pandemic at T3). We assessed positive parenting (warm and
  supportive) (T1), depressive symptoms (T1 to T3), and functional connectivity between
  the sgACC and basolateral (BLA) and centromedial amygdala (T1 and T2). We modeled
  associations among earlier positive parenting, amygdala–sgACC connectivity, and
  depressive symptoms before and during the pandemic. Results Less positive parenting
  at T1 was associated prospectively with stronger BLA–sgACC connectivity at T2 (β = −0.22)
  over and above the effect of BLA–sgACC connectivity at T1. Stronger BLA–sgACC connectivity,
  in turn, was associated with heightened depressive symptoms, both before the pandemic
  (r = 0.21) and during the pandemic (β = 0.19; independent of the effect of pre-pandemic
  symptoms). Conclusions Adolescents who experience less positive parenting may develop
  a pattern of BLA–sgACC connectivity that increases their risk for mental health
  problems. BLA–sgACC connectivity may be associated with depressive symptoms in general,
  including during periods of heightened risk for adolescents, such as the pandemic.
