abstract: Brains systems undergo unique and specific dynamic changes at the cellular,
  circuit, and systems level that underlie the transition to adult-level cognitive
  control. We integrate literature from these different levels of analyses to propose
  a novel model of the brain basis of the development of cognitive control. The ability
  to consistently exert cognitive control improves into adulthood as the flexible
  integration of component processes, including inhibitory control, performance monitoring,
  and working memory, increases. Unique maturational changes in brain structure, supported
  by interactions between dopaminergic and GABAergic systems, contribute to enhanced
  network synchronization and an improved signal-to-noise ratio. In turn, these factors
  facilitate the specialization and strengthening of connectivity in networks supporting
  the transition to adult levels of cognitive control. This model provides a novel
  understanding of the adolescent period as an adaptive period of heightened experience-seeking
  necessary for the specialization of brain systems supporting cognitive control.
