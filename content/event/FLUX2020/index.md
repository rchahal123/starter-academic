## Higher executive control network coherence buffers against puberty-related increases in internalizing symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic ##


--- 

**Background**: Early pubertal maturation has been posited to be a biopsychosocial risk factor for the onset of internalizing psychopathology in adolescence; further, early-maturing youth exhibit heightened reactivity to stressful events even in post-puberty. School closures and enforced social distancing, as well as health and financial uncertainties, during the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to adversely affect mental health in youth, particularly adolescents who are already at risk for experiencing emotional difficulties. The executive control network (ECN) supports cognitive processes required to successfully navigate novel challenges and regulate emotions in stressful contexts and may buffer against stress-related internalizing symptom increases.


**Method:**
We examined whether functional coherence of the ECN, measured via resting-state fMRI 5 years before the pandemic (at T1; Mage=11.29), is a neurobiological marker of resilience to increases in the severity of internalizing symptoms during COVID-19 (relative to 3 months prior; Mage=16.54) in adolescents who were in more advanced stages of puberty at T1 relative to their same-age peers (N=85; 49 F). Covariates included age at both time-points, early life stress, SES, and internalizing symptoms at T1.


**Results:**
On average, participants reported an increase in symptoms from the 3 months prior to pandemic to the 2 recent weeks during the pandemic (t(84)=6.00, p<.0001). We found that early-maturing youth exhibited greater increases in internalizing symptoms during the pandemic if their ECN coherence was low (B=0.49, T=3.21, p<.001); in contrast, relative pubertal stage was not associated with changes in internalizing symptoms in adolescents with higher ECN coherence at T1 (B=-0.06, T=-0.49, p=.630).


**Conclusions:**
These findings highlight the role of the functional architecture of the brain that supports executive functioning in protecting against risk factors that may exacerbate symptoms of internalizing psychopathology during periods of stress and uncertainty.
